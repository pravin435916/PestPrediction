          Plants play a crucial role in supplying food globally. Various environmental factors lead to plant diseases which results in significant production losses. However, manual detection of plant diseases is a time-consuming and error-prone process due to the fact that symptoms are not always apparent, either through visual inspection or computer analysis. It can be an unreliable method of identifying and preventing the spread of plant diseases. Emergence of accurate techniques in the field of leaf based image classification has shown impressive results.
